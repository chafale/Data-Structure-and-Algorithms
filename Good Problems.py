# 5. Inversion count in Array using Merge Sort
"""
Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. 
If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if the array is sorted 
in reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. 

Given an array a[]. The task is to find the inversion count of a[]. 
Where two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

# Hint 1: 
# so we have to find all pairs such that a[i] > a[j

# 6. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements
"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required 
to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.
"""
# Two approach to solve this problem
# Approach 1 - TLE
"""
The last element is the largest element. Therefore, diff=a[n-1]-a[0]. 
We add diff to all the elements except the last one i.e. a[n-1].
Now, the updated element at index 0 ,a'[0] is now equal to the previous largest element 
a[n-1]. 
Thus, after updation, the element a''[n-2] will become the largest element we will swap
with the previous largest and do this step again until we obtain a sorted array
"""
# Approach 2 - 
"""
The given problem can be simplified if we sort the given array once. 
If we consider a sorted array aaa, instead of trying to work on the complete problem of equalizing 
every element of the array, we can break the problem for array of size nnn into problems of solving 
arrays of smaller sizes. Assuming, the elements upto index i-1 have been equalized, we can simply 
consider the element at index i and add the difference diff=a[i]-a[i-1] to the total number of moves 
for the array upto index i to be equalized i.e. moves=moves+diff
But when we try to proceed with this step, as per a valid move, the elements following a[i]
will also be incremented by the amount diff i.e. a[j]=a[j]+diff, for j>i. 
But while implementing this approach, we need not increment all such a[j]'s. 
Instead, we'll add the number of moves done so far to the current element i.e. 
a[i] and update it to a'[i]=a[i]+moves
[i]=a[i]+moves.

Pseudo code :

nums.sort()

Initially moves = 0
for every elem starting at index 1:
    diff = moves + nums[i] - nums[i-1]
    nums[i] = nums[i] + moves
    moves = moves + diff
