# 5. Inversion count in Array using Merge Sort
"""
Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. 
If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if the array is sorted 
in reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. 

Given an array a[]. The task is to find the inversion count of a[]. 
Where two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.
"""
# Hint 1: 
# so we have to find all pairs such that a[i] > a[j 
# 
# Hint 2: use merge sort logic
